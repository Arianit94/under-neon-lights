A snapshot of Under Neon Lights, an interactive WebVR Music Video.

## Project
In order to create this project, the Within Team relied heavily on two open-source lirbaries: [Three.js](http://threejs.org) and [Frame.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/frame.js). We've taken our output which includes code and models and laid it out into the Frame.js editor which you can play around with using the link at the top of this Github repository page.

## Models
All working models are freely available in this zip: http://cdn1.with.in/541-CHEM_BROS/dist/assets/assets.zip
